Authentic sounds from vintage sound chips, on modern hardware!

## Introduction
RetroWave is a hardware sound board series that uses vintage sound chips and works with modern hardware.

They **were** in shape of Raspberry HATs, stackable, hackable, can be used on tiny single board computers like the Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano, and modern desktop computer with USB ports.

Since 2022-06, the original RetroWave series are no longer produced. You can read about what happened in [this article](https://telegra.ph/What-happened-to-RetroWave-OPL3-06-21).

The successors of the original RetroWave series is called the **RetroWave Express** series. They are available in discrete boards each with its own USB port. 100% software compatibility of the original RetroWave series is maintained.

For now, only the [RetroWave OPL3 Express](https://shop.sudomaker.com/products/retrowave-opl3-express) is available.

## Hardware
For the information of the original RetroWave series, check the history.

### Features
- Minimalistic form factor and convenient USB-C interface
- Designed with high-grade components for everyday use
- Ultra-high bandwidth provided by hardware 8080 ports

### Boards

#### OPL3 Express
Available on our official [Shopify Shop](https://shop.sudomaker.com/products/retrowave-opl3-express).

Uses the Yamaha YMF262-M chip.


... And there will be more ... are there?

## Software
The RetroWave OPL3 (Express) is supported by [DOSBox-X](https://dosbox-x.com/). The support is also ported to 86Box [by community](https://github.com/daemon32/86Box/).

For experienced users, we provide a library for accessing the boards, a reference command-line VGM player that uses the library.

All of them are free software.

### Library
Source files are in the `RetroWaveLib` directory.

#### Features
- Written in pure C
- Robust architecture using callbacks
- Easy to integrate to any project: use CMake or simply copy the files
- Provides ready-to-use platform drivers for: Linux/BSD/MacOS, Windows, and STM32 HAL

#### Problems
1. Many ARM-based Linux SBCs (including Raspberry Pi) will take a very long time locking SPI bus clock frequency if automatic CPU frequency scaling is enabled. This will lead to huge latency. In this case, please disable it (`cpufreq-set -g performance`).

### Player
Source files are in the `Player` directory.

#### Features
- Plays VGM or VGZ files
- Supports accessing the boards using serial port (on a desktop computer) and SPI (on a Linux SBC)
- Supports playback controls: Pause, Previous/Next, Fast Forward and Single Step
- Displays GD3 metadata information
- Nanoseconds accuracy on Linux/BSD and microseconds accuracy on MacOS 
- Cool real-time register map visualization!

#### Binary releases
See the [Releases](https://github.com/SudoMaker/RetroWave/releases) section.

Currently built targets:
- Linux x86_64
- Linux armhf
- Linux aarch64
- MacOS x86_64
- Windows x86_64 (Windows 7+)

#### Build
- Ensure you have the build tools, CMake 3.14+ and zlib dev package installed
- `cd` into the root path of this repo
- `mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make`

#### Problems
Currently all problems are Windows-specific.

If you are good at Windows APIs, feel free to create a pull request!

0. Emulated APIs

   Currently the Windows target uses Cygwin to emulate POSIX APIs. It works, but it may not be a good idea.


1. Possible inaccurate timing

   It seems that Windows doesn't have a monotonic self-increasing clock/timer that is unaffected by real world time changes. This may make the playback unstable. And the playback will be destroyed if a NTP time update happens in background.


2. Slow OSD

   The conhost.exe terminal is extremely laggy when repainting the whole console window. So, OSD refresh rate is set to 1 second and regmap visualization is disabled by default on Windows. If you want to see the register map visualization properly, try using MinTTY as your terminal.
